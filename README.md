# LaTeX Lecture Notes

Based on the work of Stefano Maggiolo.
For Stefano Maggiolo's original work, see [here](http://blog.poormansmath.net/latex-class-for-lecture-notes/).

These LaTeX style/class files provide a nice template for lecture notes.

(*NB*: Currently the language (`english` or `italian`) and style (`course`, `lecture`, and `talk`) options are required to avoid errors.)
